# 4-BIT-ASYNCHRONOUS-COUNTER-WITH-RESET-OPTION
In this project mainly the task is fundamentally centered on the outline of essential rationale entryways utilizing rhythm and getting effective yields and the principle criteria of planning the chips in VLSI is to decrease its size as it holds the significant part in exactness particularly when parasitic capacitances are considered. To get a proficient yield, in which specific particulars are considered in picking the transistors identified with their width and length. Schematic, Symbol and Layout these three modules are outlined where format is intended to contrast the yields and without the vicinity of inward capacitances, with separate of their truth tables.
